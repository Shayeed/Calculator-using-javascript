Here I have basically built a simple calculator for the odin curriculam project. The calculator has all the basic functionalities along with keyboard support.

Keys :-
1. Number keys
2. Oprators -> '+','-','*','/' keys
3. Get the answer -> '=' key
4. Delete one letter -> 'b' key
5. Clear everything on the screen -> 'c' key
